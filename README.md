# Desafio-iOS-Concrete-Solutions

The challenge was to make an app that use the github API to receive data in JSON and show it on the screens.

The first screen is a list of the most "starred" repositories using java language.
When you select a repository, it shows the pull requests list and the users who made them.

Created in Swift 3.0 using Alamofire and SwiftyJSON in Xcode 8.0
